*"home-cooked" api mapping json POST requests with action handlers (pre-processing, post-processing, + corresponding neo4j query to be executed)*

Used for social-media-influencer-insights project developed in part in collaboration with Tailify, 2020.

(re "home-cooked" api "framework", used for initial prototyping; should probably be ejected to/replaced by standard solutions if further development by external parties is wanted)
